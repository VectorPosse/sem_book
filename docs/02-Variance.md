## A quick refresher on the mean

Most of us were taught how to calculate the mean of a variable way back in elementary school: add up all the numbers and divide by the size of the group of numbers. In a statistics context, we often use a "bar" to indicate the mean of a variable; in other words, if a variable is called $X$, the mean is denoted $\bar{X}$. Remembering that we always use $n$ to represent the sample size, the formula is

$$
\bar{X} = \frac{\sum{X}}{n}
$$

Here is a small data set we'll use throughout this chapter as a simple example we can work "by hand":

1, 3, 3, 6, 7
